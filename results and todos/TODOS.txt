TODOS:

- baseline methods:
1. poisson distribution (distfit library)
2. logistic regression
3. Vanilla neural network
4. random forest regression
5. XGBoost regression
6. LSTM regression

- Imputation (short lapses):
1. handling missing values (imputation): mean, median, mode, KNN, MICE, etc.
2. Custom imputation: interpolation between wavelet coefficients
3. FarklÄ± istasyonlarla doldurmak (multiview learning?)
4. Find a way to handle long lapses

- how to fill zeroes and spikes? we are using microseismic
1. filling zeros with values near to zero (random gaussians)

- Handling Outliers:
1. median filter on minute scale when we read EFD first from .dat files

- First ER -> ER then ER+EFD -> ER then EFD -> ER (primary network shoud be ER, secondary network should be EFD)
1. for ER -> ER implement cascaded modules
2. for EFD+ER -> ER order of cascaded network (right now we are using EFD as primary)

- Adding input windows yearly and 3-monthly for EFD
1. Removing seasonalities (yearly and monthly) ?

- adding more statistics (mean, std, kurtosis, skewness...)

- wavelet experiments for all stations
1. threshold clipping (remove small coeffs)
2. remove big coeffs ?

- Tune neural networks
1. hyperparameter tuning
2. gradient clipping
3. batch normalization
4. weight normalization !

- for Mag experiments extend output time windows to 4-5 days

- Extropaltion to check our model detect patterns well

- new conversion formula
1. Tune basis value instead of 2. 
2. Use different basis for small eq and big eq 

- Fuse 2 stations
1. Random forest similarities for multi-view learning.

- Real time online predictions

- reimplementation of old code (library)
